The form elements are enhanced with the Tailwind **forms plugin**.
Editing events now uses a modal built with the **Headless UI** Dialog component.
The app starts with a simple **login page** and once authenticated displays a
sidebar layout for managing events.

This repository now includes a Laravel backend in the `laravel-app` folder.
Run `npm install` inside that directory and use `npm run dev` to start both the
PHP server and Vite for a full-stack monolithic experience.
